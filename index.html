            <p>This just in... I'm a former martial artist, with some Judo and an advanced belt in Karate.  I dig trivia, music, classic video games, slots and poker. I'm a kindness advocate and Autism volunteer, inspired by my beautiful daughter Ally Meghan. I believe in doing the right thing, taking the high road, positivity and helping others.  I believe in human potential and I read about it often.  I'm continually working on improving in life!  Psst... I'm also a former stand up comedian and plus sized model, okay one is true. a favorite I apply whenever possible: Dobbins lost his eye in an accident and couldn'tafford the price of a glass eye. So he carved one out of wood. But he was so self-conscious that he neverleft the house.   Finally, his friend Eddy came over and forced him to go out. "There's a dance over at the club," he said."So what if one of your eyes is made out of wood?"

"All right," said Dobbins, "but if anybody makes fun
of my eye I'm leaving."

He went to the dance and stood around, trying to
build up his courage. And then he saw a woman standing
alone in the corner. She was very attractive, but she
had a hunchback.

"She's worse off than I," Dobbins thought. "The
least I can do is ask her to dance.

He walked across the crowded dance floor and
approached the girl. "Would you care to dance?" he
asked.

she replied... "Would I?!"</p></h4>

									<h2>Software Programmer and Web Developer</h2>
									<font color="chartreuse">
								  <p>As a full time Programmer/Analyst I've worked in the following industries: eCommerce (GE), Electric Parts Retail and Distribution (Steiner Electric) and Sporting Good Distribution (Faber Brothers).  I've had many victories in the most recent 11 years in the Financial Industry with Societe Generale, one of the world's largest banks, with a heavy emphasis on Data and Software.</p>  <p>In August of 2018 after several months in school sharpening my coding skills, I launched my Kindness Application empowering skills in Ruby, Vue.js, HTML and CSS. I was overwhelmed with positive emotions and coding pride to begin a Pay it Forward meets Where is George kindness application!  The Pay it Forward has begun, as I've done two acts of random kindness and started the chain already. One made my Mom cry tears of joy. Please click <a href="https://stark-ocean-36231.herokuapp.com/#/">here or the cartoon to see the A.R.K. of the Whammynet adding more kindness to the world! <img src = "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5f/a0/7f/5fa07f35d834245f8474b05ea5a6f903.jpg" class="center"</a></p>

									<p>Paperboy at 11, Dishwasher at 15, Pizza Delivery Guy at 17, Market Researcher 17 to 23 during college breaks and after for a year, Dorm and Concert Security while at Northern Illinois University, Award winning Customer Service agent at 23 with GE, promoted to team lead 24, promoted to Telemarketing Communication Coordinator, my first technical job at 26, after working with code as a liaison, I was hooked, so I went to a Technical School for Oracle Forms and Development, promoted to Informix 4GL Programmer/Analyst at 29 (GE)...  Perhaps I shouldn't share my background according to internet wisdom, but I feel this shows my very employable, quality promotable, work ethic.</p>
